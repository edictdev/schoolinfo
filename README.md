# schoolinfo
A simple Mahara module which provides functions to return school sessions and terms.

To install place in the module folder and enable on the extensions page.

Sample usage can be found in the index.php file and you can view the results once the module is installed on your site by going to /module/schoolinfo

Tested against Mahara 15.04

Please note that the model for the terms is one that we use in Scotland where we have three terms,
so it might not fit your model if you have four or more (I don't know if this is the case anywhere),
however two should be covered by the existing code (Again, I don't know if this is the case anywhere),
You are of course free to alter the code yourself under the GPL or message me on the mahara.org site if you
have any ideas for changes or features.
